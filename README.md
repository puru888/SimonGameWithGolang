<h4 align="center">Build the exciting web-based game in which players must repeat random sequences of 
colors by pressing the pop-upped colored squares in the correct order. In this project, I have 
used Go-Lang for the back-end and HTML, CSS, and JQuery for the front-end. It’s a fast-paced play in which the user has to remember the color sequence after pressing the right 
sequence user advances to a higher level.</h4>
